- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @maksburg, and I'm on a journey to the hidden corners of the web, doing some cool stuff like hosting websites on the deep web.
- ðŸ’¡ My Vision is to make the web a place where you can explore without worrying about who's watching. The deep web offers a unique way to protect your privacy and share information freely.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in exploring the deep web or building websites, you can find me buried in lines of code, always eager to learn and create.
- ðŸ”— Connect with Me, feel free to connect with me here on GitHub. I'll be sharing my deep web hosting projects, web development experiments, and other tech adventures. Let's collaborate, share ideas, and make the web more fun and private together.
- ðŸ“§ Get in Touch, got a project idea or just want to chat? You can drop me a line at github.many408@passinbox.com.
